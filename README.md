Restricting solutions to using only the Python standard library and `numpy`. 
No bonus points for clean, neat, clever or optimized solutions.

As an experiment, I relied on Copilot for some of these. My general verdict is that it was very useful for the easiest puzzles and then unhelpful to the point of being actively anti-helpful on harder puzzles.
